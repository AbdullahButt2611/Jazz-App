# Jazz-App
This is a project which is property of Two members. The project is actually the combination of two mobile apps called **Jazz Cash** and **Jazz World** with some aditional features added. However, it's just a desktop based aapplication and directly accessible on the file systsem as no database has been yet connected to the system. 

>It should be kept in mind, that this is just a university project and we have just cloned this project for our term system. No rights have been bought from **Jazz**, So the original Rights beong to them only.

## Outcome of Project

<br><br>
## Description
So basically this project again has the two actors, one is the user which will have to first get registered into the system to be able to use the system and the other is admin of the system which are given all the rights to use the system accroding to the needs. The user have to get a unique number to get registered otherwise, the user wont be allowed to get registered. Similarly the user will be updated with the ba;ance once he\she gets active into the syetem. Depending on the need, the system has all the features that the jazz cash and jazz world has.

### Note
> Again reminding that no API has been used to connect it to the official Jazz Apps.

**Project Name: Jazz-App**

**Introduction:**
Jazz-App is a Java-based application developed as a group project for a final academic assignment. The project aims to provide a robust and scalable software solution, leveraging the full capabilities of Java to deliver high performance and maintainability. The application serves as a practical demonstration of teamwork and the application of best practices in software engineering, targeting real-world usability and extensibility.

**Key Features:**
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design ensures ease of navigation and a positive user experience.
- **Modular Architecture:** The codebase is organized into distinct modules, promoting clarity and simplifying future enhancements.
- **Robust Data Management:** Efficient handling and persistence of user and application data through well-defined data access layers.
- **Security Mechanisms:** Implementation of authentication and authorization to safeguard user information and application resources.
- **Extensibility:** Designed to easily accommodate new features and integrations as project requirements evolve.

**Design Patterns Used:**
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC):** Separates the application into three interconnected components—Model (data), View (user interface), and Controller (business logic)—to enhance maintainability and scalability.
  - *Explanation:* By using MVC, the project allows for independent development, testing, and upgrading of each component, which streamlines collaboration and reduces the risk of errors when the application grows.
- **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures that certain critical objects are instantiated only once throughout the application's lifecycle.
  - *Explanation:* This pattern is typically used for managing configuration settings or database connections, preventing resource duplication and ensuring consistent behavior.

**Advanced Concepts:**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The application structure emphasizes encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making the codebase reusable and easier to maintain.
  - *Explanation:* OOP principles allow developers to model real-world entities directly in the code, making it straightforward to add new features or modify existing ones.
- **Exception Handling:** Comprehensive strategies are in place to manage runtime errors gracefully, ensuring stability and reliability.
  - *Explanation:* Thoughtful error handling minimizes disruptions and provides meaningful feedback to users, resulting in a smoother experience.
- **Thread Management (if applicable):** If the application includes concurrent operations, Java threads are used to optimize performance for tasks like data processing or network communication.
  - *Explanation:* Proper thread management allows the application to perform multiple operations simultaneously without compromising responsiveness.

**Conclusion:**
Jazz-App stands as a testament to effective collaboration and the thoughtful application of software engineering principles. Through its modular design, utilization of proven design patterns, and incorporation of advanced programming concepts, the project not only fulfills its academic purpose but also serves as a strong foundation for future development and innovation. Its significance lies in both its technical robustness and its demonstration of best practices, making it a noteworthy contribution to educational and practical software development.
